Build:

make

Install:

make install

Run: 

./shell

Notes:

The 'get' syntax is as per

	get HOME

rather than the Bourne standard of

	echo $HOME

Similarly 'set' syntax is as per

	set HOME /home/seh

rather than the Bourne standard of

	HOME=/home/seh

Notice: set must be used with one space after set and one space after the variable name (if a value is to be assigned).
