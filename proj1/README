Supported built in commands:

* exit
* pid
* ppid
* cd [directory] (with and without arguments, i.e. cd with no args to cd to $HOME)
* pwd
* jobs
* set VAR [value]
* get VAR

Other commands are handled via $PATH searching and summary execution.

Supported features:

* Output redirection to a file via '>'
* Backgrounding of a child process via '&'

---

Notes:

* The 'get' syntax is as per

	get HOME

rather than the Bourne standard of

	echo $HOME

* Similarly 'set' syntax is as per

	set HOME /home/seh

rather than the Bourne standard of

	HOME=/home/seh

Notice: Set must be used with one space after set and one space after the variable name (if a value is to be assigned). Additionally, values for variables being set must not begin with a whitespace character. 

* Output redirection to a file can be done as per

	pwd > test

or

	echo hi >test

Notice: A space must separate the command and the '>' character as to define that redirection is intended. Redirection to things other than files or usage of '<' is not supported. 

* Backgrounding is done via adding an ampersand (&) to the end of a command. The ampersand must have a space preceding it as to define that backgrounding is intended.

Notice: Backgrounding with redirection to a file works! Try: cat /dev/urandom > mytestfile &. Additionally, if you wish to background a process, allow no stray whitespace after the & symbol.
